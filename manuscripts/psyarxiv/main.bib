  abstract	= {Background: Inhibitory deficits are common in
		  psychopathology. Emotion-related impulsivity (ERI) and
		  rumination are general risk factors for psychiatric
		  distress that are similarly associated with dysfunctional
		  inhibition—particularly in affective contexts. A number
		  of cognitive remediation procedures have been developed to
		  improve inhibitory control; however, most remediation
		  programs focus on “cold” cognition independent of
		  affective processing. This pilot trial will gather
		  preliminary evidence for a new cognitive training
		  intervention targeting “hot” affective control (ie,
		  inhibitory functions during elevated emotional arousal) in
		  a transdiagnostic sample of adults who report heightened
		  emotion dysregulation. Objective: This manuscript describes
		  a protocol for a pilot randomized waitlist-controlled trial
		  to assess changes in ERI and rumination after
		  neurobehavioral affective control training (N-ACT), an
		  8-week cognitive training intervention designed to improve
		  emotional response inhibition and emotional working memory.
		  Our primary aim is to evaluate the efficacy, feasibility,
		  and acceptability of N-ACT in reducing rumination and ERI,
		  which we respectively conceptualize as complementary
		  cognitive and behavioral consequences of emotion
		  dysregulation. Secondarily, we will examine whether N-ACT
		  leads to improvements in inhibitory control and, more
		  distally, psychopathology symptoms. Methods: The final
		  sample will comprise 80 adults who report high ERI or
		  rumination. Participants will be randomized to (1) begin
		  the N-ACT program without delay or (2) join a waitlist
		  condition and then complete N-ACT. Exclusion criteria
		  include active alcohol or substance use disorders,
		  psychosis, and suicide risk. At the baseline and
		  postintervention time points, participants will complete
		  measures of emotion dysregulation and psychiatric symptoms,
		  as well as a neuropsychological assessment of inhibitory
		  control. Individuals assigned to the control group will
		  undergo an identical assessment before joining the
		  waitlist, followed by parallel assessments before and after
		  N-ACT. Results: This trial is funded by support from the
		  University of California Board of Regents and the Peder
		  Sather Foundation (funding period: October 2022-September
		  2025). Recruitment is scheduled to begin in spring 2025. We
		  will begin data analysis once data collection is complete,
		  which is planned to occur in fall 2025. Conclusions: This
		  pilot randomized waitlist-controlled trial is designed to
		  assess the initial efficacy, feasibility, and acceptability
		  of N-ACT, a novel cognitive remediation approach developed
		  to address 2 key contributors to psychopathology: ERI and
		  rumination. The N-ACT program uses computerized adaptive
		  behavioral tasks to strengthen the affective control
		  processes theoretically and empirically linked to ERI and
		  rumination. We hope this work will help inform future
		  studies with sufficient statistical power to ascertain
		  whether enhancing affective control through cognitive
		  training (N-ACT) produces downstream reductions in
		  psychiatric symptoms via improved emotion regulation.

		  We introduce marginaleffects, a package for R and Python
		  which offers a simple and powerful interface to compute all
		  of those quantities, and to conduct (non-)linear hypothesis
		  and equivalence tests on them. marginaleffects is
		  lightweight; extensible; it works well in combination with

		  specialties., Results After extended consultation over
		  three iterations, we revised the three-talk model by making

		  patient goals, providing a clear set of tasks for each talk
		  category, and adding suggested scripts to illustrate each

  abstract	= {Over forty-three million people experience a mental health
		  issue annually. Mental health issues can make financial
		  situations more complicated and financial stability more
		  difficult to achieve. Furthermore, financial institutions
		  are missing out on an opportunity to effectively serve the
		  millions of Americans who live with a mental health
		  disability. Building on the research of Dr. Annie
		  Harper—which itself is grounded in the perspectives and
		  life experiences of individuals with mental health
		  disabilities—this report proposes that financial
		  institutions offer supportive banking features in order to
		  make their products and services more accessible. In
		  particular, there are three features that responsible
		  financial institutions could easily implement: 1)
		  customizable mobile banking notifications, 2) self-imposed
		  spending limits on debit cards, and 3) view-only account
		  access. These features would both respond to the expressed
		  needs of individuals with mental health disabilities, as
		  well as comply with existing federal banking laws and
		  regulations. In addition, these features will also appeal
		  to a wide range of current and potential customers, such as
		  young adults, individuals with disabilities, and older
		  populations. Banking for All explains both why financial
		  institutions should better serve individuals with mental
		  health disabilities, and how these institutions might go
		  about implementing these different features. Financial
		  institutions have an opportunity to increase accessibility,
		  and in so doing, help strengthen the financial health of
		  individuals, families, and communities.},

  abstract	= {Background: Risk-taking behaviours during hypomanic states
		  are recognised, however the high-risk nature of some
		  behaviours—including the potential for harm to both the
		  individual and others—has not been detailed in the
		  research literature. The current study examines risk-taking
		  behaviours and their consequences (including their
		  potential for impairment) in those with a bipolar II
		  condition. Method: Participants were recruited from the
		  Sydney-based Black Dog Institute Depression Clinic.
		  Diagnostic assignment of bipolar II disorder was based on
		  clinician judgement and formal DSM-IV criteria.
		  Participants completed a series of detailed questions
		  assessing previous risk-taking behaviours during hypomanic
		  states. Results: The sample comprised a total of 93
		  participants. Risk-taking behaviours during hypomania
		  included spending signiﬁcant amounts of money, excessive
		  alcohol or drug use, dangerous driving and endangering
		  sexual activities. Key consequences included interpersonal
		  conﬂict, substantial ﬁnancial burden and feelings of
		  guilt, shame and remorse. Despite recognition of the risks
		  and consequences associated with hypomanic behaviours, less
		  than one-ﬁfth of participants agreed that hypomania
		  should be treated because of the associated risks.
		  Limitations: Study limitations included a cross-sectional
		  design, reliance on self-report information, lack of
		  controlling for current mood state, and comprised a
		  tertiary referral sample that may be weighted to more
		  severe cases. Findings may therefore not be generalisable
		  and require replication. Conclusions: Risk-taking
		  behaviours during hypomania are common, and often linked
		  with serious consequences. Whilst hypomania is often
		  enjoyed and romanticised by patients—leading to
		  ambivalence around treatment of such states—careful
		  consideration of the impact of risk-taking behaviour is
		  necessary, while the study raises the question as to what
		  is ‘impairment’ in hypomania. Findings should advance
		  clinical management by identifying those high-risk
		  behaviours that would beneﬁt from pre-emptive weighting
		  in developing individual’s wellbeing plans for managing
		  the condition.},

  abstract	= {For more than a century, concern for privacy (CFP) has
		  co-evolved with advances in information technology. The CFP
		  refers to the anxious sense of interest that a person has
		  because of various types of threats to the person's state
		  of being free from intrusion. Research studies have
		  validated this concept and identified its consequences. For
		  example, research has shown that the CFP can have a
		  negative influence on the adoption of information
		  technology; but little is known about factors likely to
		  influence such concern. This paper attempts to fill that
		  gap. Because privacy is said to be a part of a more general
		  ‘right to one's personality’, we consider the so-called
		  ‘Big Five’ personality traits (agreeableness,
		  extraversion, emotional stability, openness to experience,
		  and conscientiousness) as factors that can influence
		  privacy concerns. Protection motivation theory helps us to
		  explain this influence in the context of an emerging
		  pervasive technology: location-based services. Using a
		  survey-based approach, we find that agreeableness,
		  conscientiousness, and openness to experience each affect
		  the CFP. These results have implications for the adoption,
		  the design, and the marketing of highly personalized new

  abstract	= {Background: Given gaps in the treatment of mental health,
		  brief adaptive interventions have become a public health
		  imperative. Transdiagnostic interventions may be
		  particularly appropriate given high rates of medical
		  comorbidity and the broader reach of transdiagnostic
		  therapies. One such approach utilized herein is acceptance
		  and commitment therapy (ACT), which is focused on
		  increasing engagement with values, awareness, and openness
		  to internal experiences. ACT theory posits that
		  experiential avoidance is at the center of human suffering,
		  regardless of diagnosis, and, as such, seeks to reduce
		  unworkable experiential avoidance. Objective: Our objective
		  is to provide the rationale and protocol for examining the
		  safety, feasibility, and effectiveness of optimizing an
		  ACT-based intervention via a mobile app among two disparate
		  samples, which differ in sociodemographic characteristics
		  and symptom profiles. Methods: Twice each day, participants
		  are prompted via a mobile app to complete assessments of
		  mood and activity and are then randomly assigned to an
		  ACT-based intervention or not. These interventions are
		  questions regarding engagement with values, awareness, and
		  openness to internal experiences. Participant responses are
		  recorded. Analyses will examine completion of assessments,
		  change in symptoms from baseline assessment, and proximal
		  change in mood and activity. A primary outcome of interest
		  is proximal change in activity (eg, form and function of
		  behavior and energy consumed by avoidance and values-based
		  behavior) following interventions as a function of time,
		  symptoms, and behavior, where we hypothesize that
		  participants will focus more energy on values-based
		  behaviors. Analyses will be conducted using a weighted and
		  centered least squares approach. Two samples will run
		  concurrently to assess the capacity of optimizing mobile
		  ACT in populations that differ widely in their clinical
		  presentation and sociodemographic characteristics:
		  individuals with bipolar disorder (n=30) and distressed
		  first-generation college students (n=50). Results:
		  Recruitment began on September 10, 2019, for the bipolar
		  sample and on October 5, 2019, for the college sample.
		  Participation in the study began on October 18, 2019.
		  Conclusions: This study examines an ACT-based intervention
		  among two disparate samples. Should ACT demonstrate
		  feasibility and preliminary effectiveness in each sample, a
		  large randomized controlled trial applying ACT across
		  diagnoses and demographics would be indicated. The public
		  health implications of such an approach may be
		  far-reaching.},

		  on disruptive life events by using publicly available data
		  on disruptive life events, aggregated by a consumer credit
		  reporting agency in conjunction with electronic health

		  to (1) an active comparison group with diagnoses of major
		  depressive disorder (MDD) and (2) a general health (GH)
		  cohort without diagnoses of BPI, schizophrenia, or MDD.
		  Patients with diagnoses of BPI or schizophrenia and their

		  were White (30 167 [65\%]). In addition, 18 500
		  patients with BPI (62\%) and 6552 patients with
		  schizophrenia (41\%) were female. Patients with BPI were
		  more likely to change addresses than patients in either
		  comparison cohort (with the incidence ratio being as high
		  as 1.25 [95\% CI, 1.23-1.28]) when compared with GH cohort.
		  Patients with BPI were also more likely to experience any

  abstract	= {Bipolar disorder creates many potential adaptive problems
		  in daily living, including poor social functioning,
		  impulsive behavior, substance abuse, and chronic
		  unemployment. Additionally, individuals with bipolar
		  disorder experience higher morbidity and mortality rates
		  relative to the general population due to increased
		  commission of dangerous behaviors, including increased
		  substance abuse and driving while under the influence of
		  drugs and alcohol, unprotected sex, and elevated risk of
		  suicidality. While commission of such risky behaviors
		  contributes to functional impairment and increased risk of
		  mortality, there has been little targeted attention to
		  their treatment in patients with bipolar illness. The aim
		  of this study was to facilitate patients' recognition and
		  reduction of risk-taking behavior. One-hundred one
		  outpatients with a DSM-IV-TR diagnosed bipolar disorder
		  were screened. Using a multiple-baseline single-subject
		  design, seven of these individuals with bipolar disorder
		  who engaged in frequent risk-taking behaviors received
		  treatment using a mindfulness-based imaginal exposure from
		  the Mindfulness Based Relapse Prevention program. Visual
		  inspection revealed declines in self-reported risk-taking
		  for each participant, beginning during the intervention or
		  follow-up. Current measurement tools are limited, and
		  better methods are needed to assess risk-taking adequately.
		  It was concluded that the mindfulness-based imaginal
		  exposure can be a useful tool to reduce risk-taking
		  behaviors in individuals with bipolar disorder.},

		  This study aimed to examine the relationship between
		  finances and mental health in bipolar disorder across two
		  time points. Methods: Fifty-four participants with bipolar
		  disorder in a National Health Service community mental
		  health service completed questionnaires examining financial
		  difficulties, compulsive buying and perceived financial
		  well-being. Questionnaires also measured alcohol
		  dependence, stress, depression, anxiety, past and current
		  manic symptoms. Results: Partial correlations showed
		  correlations over time: depression, anxiety and stress
		  predicted later compulsive buying. Compulsive buying also
		  predicted later anxiety. Lower perceived financial wellness
		  increased anxiety and stress over time. Being on benefits
		  was associated with higher depression and going without
		  items such as clothes was linked to higher depression,
		  stress, anxiety and past hypomanic symptoms. Conclusions:
		  Financial difficulties are related to mental health in
		  bipolar disorder. Poor mental health leads to compulsive
		  buying, whereas worry about finances increases anxiety and
		  stress, with a vicious cycle for anxiety.},

  abstract	= {Many behaviors posing significant risks to public health
		  are characterized by repeated decisions to forego better
		  long-term outcomes in the face of immediate temptations.
		  Steeply discounting the value of delayed outcomes often
		  underlies a pattern of impulsive choice. Steep delay
		  discounting is correlated with addictions (e.g., substance
		  abuse, obesity) and behaviors such as seatbelt use and
		  risky sexual activity. As evidence accumulates suggesting
		  steep delay discounting plays a causal role in these
		  maladaptive behaviors, researchers have begun testing
		  methods for reducing discounting. In this first systematic
		  and comprehensive review of this literature, the findings
		  of 92 articles employing different methodologies to reduce
		  discounting are evaluated narratively and
		  meta-analytically. Although most of the methods reviewed
		  produced significant reductions in discounting, they varied
		  in effect sizes. Most methods were ideal for influencing
		  one-off choices (e.g., framing and priming manipulations),
		  although other successful manipulations, such as episodic
		  future thinking, could be incorporated into existing
		  therapies designed to produce longer-lasting changes in
		  decision-making. The largest and longest-lasting effects
		  were produced by learning-based manipulations, although
		  translational research is needed to determine the
		  generality and clinical utility of these methods.
		  Methodological shortcomings in the existing literature and
		  suggestions for ameliorating these issues are discussed.
		  This review reveals a variety of methods with translational
		  potential, which, through continued refinement, may prove
		  effective in reducing impulsive choice and its associated
		  maladaptive decisions that negatively impact quality of

  abstract	= {Severe and Enduring Eating Disorders (SEED), in particular
		  SEED-Anorexia Nervosa (SE-AN), may represent the most
		  difficult disorder to treat in psychiatry. Furthermore, the
		  lack of empirical research in this patient group, and,
		  consequently the lack of guidelines, call for an urgent
		  increase in research and discussion within this field.
		  Meanwhile experts concur that effective care should be
		  structured in a collaborative manner. To identify the
		  challenges in providing care to patients with SE-AN in the
		  Dutch healthcare context, and propose a collaborative care
		  treatment model to address these issues. A pragmatic
		  mixed-method approach was used, structured as follows: (1)
		  Identifying perceived barriers and treatment needs from the
		  viewpoint of both patients and eating disorder healthcare
		  professionals through an evaluation questionnaire; (2)
		  Investigating current treatment practices for SEED/SE-AN
		  via benchmarking; (3) Gaining insight into the optimal
		  structure and content of care by interviewing network
		  partners and experts-by-experience. Based on these
		  findings, and drawing from literature on severe and
		  enduring disorders, a treatment model for SE-AN was
		  proposed and implemented. The key challenges identified
		  included a lack of knowledge about eating disorders among
		  network partners, treatment ambivalence among patients and
		  poor collaboration between professionals. The proposed
		  model enhances self-management and collaborative
		  relationships with healthcare providers, offers
		  user-friendly and practical guidance, and aims at
		  stabilization, reducing relapses, deterioration, and
		  readmissions, thereby being cost-effective. Importantly,
		  the model operates across levels of care (primary,
		  secondary, tertiary). This study, describing a
		  collaborative care program for SE-AN, developed and
		  implemented in a highly specialized treatment center for
		  eating disorders, sets the stage for further
		  explanatory/efficacy research to build on the findings in
		  this study, with the following aims: addressing the
		  critical gap in care for SEED/SE-AN, improving better
		  healthcare organization, reducing relapse rates, and
		  lowering costs for this often overlooked patient group.
		  Severe and Enduring Eating Disorders (SEED), and

		  This study aimed to understand the obstacles in caring for

		  proposed a collaborative care model to address the issues.
		  Through surveys, interviews, and benchmarking, key
		  challenges were identified, including limited knowledge
		  about eating disorders, patient ambivalence, and poor
		  professional collaboration. The collaborative care model
		  for SE-AN that was proposed in this study emphasizes
		  structured care coordination, education for network

  abstract = {In everyday decision-making, individuals make trade-offs between short-term and long-term benefits or costs. Depending on many factors, individuals may choose to wait for larger delayed reward, yet in other situations they may prefer the smaller, immediate reward. In addition to within-subject variation in the short-term versus long-term reward trade-off, there are also interindividual differences in delay discounting (DD), which have been shown to be quite stable. The extent to which individuals discount the value of delayed rewards turns out to be associated with important health and disorder-related outcomes: the more discounting, the more unhealthy or problematic choices. This has led to the hypothesis that DD can be conceptualized as trans-disease process. The current systematic review presents an overview of behavioral trainings and manipulations that have been developed to reduce DD in human participants aged 12 years or older. Manipulation studies mostly contain one session and measure DD directly after the manipulation. Training studies add a multiple session training component that is not per se related to DD, in between two DD task measurements. Ninety-eight studies (151 experiments) were identified that tested behavioral trainings and manipulations to decrease DD. Overall, results indicated that DD can be decreased, showing that DD is profoundly context dependent and changeable. Most promising avenues to pursue in future research seem to be acceptance-based/mindfulness-based trainings, and even more so manipulations involving a future orientation. Limitations and recommendations are discussed to identify the mechanistic processes that allow for changes in discount rate and behavior accordingly.},
